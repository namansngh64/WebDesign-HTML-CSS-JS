# WebDesign-HTML-CSS-JS
I tried to design a look-a-like of fittr.com for practice purpose using HTML,CSS,Bootstrap and a little Javascript.

And the second file is purely made using Javascript (HTML and CSS too ofcourse).It's a kind of percentage calculator and I made this project to understand the basic(kind of moderate) use of javascript in real world projects.You can check it out.(#Practice-Project).
